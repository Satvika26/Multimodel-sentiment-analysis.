This project is Task 4 in the AI internship at COTHON SOLUTIONS where I applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze Amazon product reviews, extracting key insights about customer sentiment. Here's a summary of the steps involved:
Data Collection & Preprocessing:
I loaded a sample dataset containing 500 Amazon reviews.
Conducted some basic exploration to understand the distribution of review scores and sample data.
Sentiment Analysis using Vader:
Applied Vader Sentiment Analysis to categorize reviews into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.
Visualized sentiment scores across various review star ratings, highlighting trends in customer sentiment.
Advanced Sentiment Analysis with Roberta:
Used Roberta, a pre-trained transformer model, to conduct more sophisticated sentiment analysis.
Combined Vader and Roberta results to get a deeper understanding of sentiment distribution and model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis:
Plotted key visualizations including compound sentiment scores, and sentiment breakdowns by Vader and Roberta.
Performed pairwise analysis of sentiment scores, helping to compare model outputs.
Key Insights:
Discovered interesting anomalies where certain low-star reviews were classified positively by Roberta, while others were seen as negative by Vader.
Highlighted the most positive and most negative reviews for both 1-star and 5-star ratings, providing a granular view of customer emotions.
üîç Objective:
 By leveraging both classical sentiment analysis (Vader) and state-of-the-art transformer-based models (Roberta), this project allowed me to gain a richer understanding of customer feedback and sentiment trends across various product categories.
üìà Next Steps:
 Exploring how these sentiment scores could be integrated into product recommendation systems, sentiment-based trend analysis, and customer feedback analytics.
